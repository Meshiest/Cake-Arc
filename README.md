## Cake's Arc Theme

Original credit to [varlesh](https://github.com/varlesh) for the original Arc-Dark KDE theme, and [horst3180 for the Arc Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme)

Titlebar icons come from [andreyorst's Breezemite](https://github.com/andreyorst/Breezemite)

### Install:

* `cd ~/.local/share/aurorae/themes`
* `git clone https://github.com/Meshiest/Cake-Arc`
* Select theme in kde window decorations selector

### Why can I not resize my windows?

* I always found it tedious to drag tiny little window borders. As a result, I removed them and only use **Alt+Rightclick to resize**, **Alt+Leftclick to move**.
